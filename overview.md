The version of Scratch included with the Raspberry Pi has a number of unique features, one of the most useful is its ability to communicate with the **G**eneral **P**urpose **I**nput **O**utput pins or GPIO. These pins allow you to connect your Raspberry Pi to a range of devices from lights and motors to buttons and sensors. The Raspberry Pi 2 has 40 GPIO pins, whilst the original Raspberry Pi only has 26, this workshop will work for either model.
